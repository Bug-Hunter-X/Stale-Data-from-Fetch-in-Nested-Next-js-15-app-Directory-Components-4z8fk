# Stale Data from Fetch in Nested Next.js 15 app Directory Components

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15's `app` directory where data fetching within a `useEffect` hook in a deeply nested component may not update correctly if parent components re-render. This is particularly problematic when dealing with dynamic data.

The issue seems to stem from the way React's reconciliation process interacts with the `fetch` call in `useEffect` within a nested component structure. Even with changes in the dependency array, the `fetch` may not always be triggered.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the component and how it fails to update when expected.

## Solution

The provided solution file (`bugSolution.js`) demonstrates a way to circumvent this behavior using a combination of techniques that will ensure data is refreshed when the parent components re-render, ensuring the data stays up-to-date.
