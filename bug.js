In Next.js 15, an uncommon issue arises when using the `app` directory's `fetch` within a React component's `useEffect` hook.  If the component is deeply nested within other components and those parent components re-render, the `fetch` call inside `useEffect` may not trigger as expected. This happens even if the dependency array in `useEffect` changes, leading to stale data or a non-functional component.
